CONTRIBUTING TO THIS PLUGIN
===========================

Please note this repository is only a mirror.
Our main development does _not_ take place on github. For this reason, among
others, _do not file merge requests_ on the main branch.
All merge requests on the main branch will be denied as per default.

You are welcome to contribute to this plugin, but exclusively under the
following rules:

* You will first file an issue on the issue tracker.
* Please await a response from us if you haven't provided a testable patch (it
  may well be that your issue was already resolved but not pushed to github yet).
* When filing for a feature request, be aware and ready to start a discussion
  about necessities or reasoning or a general discussion about general relevance.
* When you've provided a patch, allow us to review and test your work and await
  any response.
* Please be patient! Our open source efforts are not driven commercially, so we
  cannot always make time to reply instantly.
