SEBSOFT PAYMENTS ENROLMENT PLUGIN

The Sebsoft PaymentS enrolment Plugin offers you the possibility to set up paid courses.
It uses core Moodle's payment gateways to provide payments supporting a wide variety of payment methods.

-----
COUPONS
The payments enrolment plugin provides full support for discount coupons to be created for courses.
A coupon is created either for a specific course or for any accessible course (site wide).
Coupons consist of a startdate and enddate, a percentual discount, the course
it was created for, an optional maximum usage and the coupon code itself.

Once installed, you can manage all coupons from the new administration tree menu.
When you're administrating a course, and the course has the gwpayments enrolment
method enabled for the course, the gwpayments plugin creates it's own menu item
in the course administration tree.
When you create coupons from there, it's bound to the specific course you're editing.

-----
